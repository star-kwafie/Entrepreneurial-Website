            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Hi everyone! We are Penbook, a company created and run by four seventh grade girls: 
            Caroline, Ada, Lola, and Maya (C.A.L.M.), for our Entrepreneurial class at the Girls' Middle School. 
            All of us are well versed in the ancient art of crafting hand-made penbooks.</p>
            <p><li>Caroline is our VP of Marketing who is crazy about pink and sports, and really wants to work 
            for the FBI or the CIA.</li></p>
            <p><li>Ada is our VP of Sales, a science fiction nerd who likes astrophysics, Star Trek, 
            and writing.</li></p>
            <p><li>Lola is our VP of Communications, who loves dogs, animals, horseback riding, and drawing 
            cartoons (and she brings M&Ms to our meetings :D).</li></p>
            <p><li>Maya is our VP of Manufacturing, who likes programming, reading, school, and homework.</li></p>
