            <p>Hi everyone! We are Penbook, a company created and run by four seventh grade girls: 
            Ada, Maya, Caroline, and Lola. We are from the Girls' Middle School in California. We 
            created this company as part of a project in our Entrepreneurial class.</p>
            <p>Maya is our VP of Manufacturing, who likes science, drawing, math, school, and 
            homework.</p>
            <p>Ada is our VP of Sales, who is a science fiction nerd and likes astrophysics, Star Trek, 
            and writing.</p>
            <p>Caroline is our VP of Marketing, who is crazy, loves pink, loves sports, and wants to work 
            for the FBI or the CIA.</p>
            <p>Lola is our VP of Communications, who loves dogs, animals, horseback riding, and drawing 
            cartoons.</p>
